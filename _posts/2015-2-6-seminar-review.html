<p>Third Seminar, 6th February 2015</p>


<p>On the evening of 6th February 2015, we were delighted to have Professor Sydney Chung as our guest speaker for our third seminar titled "Surgical Challenges in the Tropics". Professor Chung is one of the most locally renowned surgical pioneers as well as the former Dean of the Medical Faculty of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>
		
		
<p>During the seminar, Professor Chung shared his experiences of treating impoverished patients in Papua New Guinea from 2004 to 2007. The country was amidst hostile circumstances at the time; Its medical resources were thus inadequate to provide proper treatment to its people. Despite having limited equipment, Professor Chung seeked to overcome challenges by maximizing resources available and drawing upon his innovation. In a particularly memorable operation, he utilized fishing lines in place of suturing threads. His patients were commonly victims of domestic violence and intertribal conflicts, whose suffering extended beyond the physiological level. While technology unquestionably facilitates diagnosis and treatment, Professor Chung believed that physicians shall be wary of its overreliance; Hands-on clinical skills and a quick mind will always remain fundamental to successful surgical operations.</p>

<p>On a lighter note, Professor Chung shared with us his favourite pastimes - skydiving and training with his saxophone. A fervent musical fan, he also hopes to become a member of a jazz band to give public performances.</p>

<p>Three years of serving in the Oceanian country proves to be a life-transforming experience for Professor Chung, not only offering him deeper insights into local struggles but a new perspective on humanity. We hope you found the seminar inspiring and stimulating, and we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming activities!</p>
