<P>On Friday, March 24th, we hosted our first careers night of the year at the Prince of Wales Hospital. For the event, we were pleased to invite Dr Simon Wong, an upper GI and metabolic surgeon and Dr Simon Hou, a urologist to share their experiences and knowledge of surgery. Helping themselves to pizza and soda, a group of medical students from both clinical and pre-clinical years, discussed a number of topics with our guests. This included details regarding posts in basic and higher surgical training programs, choosing the right hospital for surgical training, choosing a specialty, surgery vs academia and many more questions. It was an insightful evening for everyone, providing exposure to medical students on surgery or for the more committed, reinforcing their passions in entering this rewarding discipline.</p><P>Once again, SSAHK would like to thank Dr Wong and Dr Hou for their insightful contributions. For those who missed the event or were unable to attend due to other commitments, don't hesitate to join us for our second careers night to be held in HKU after the summer.</p>
