<h2>Basic Suturing Workshop 2017</h2>
<p>The basic suturing workshop will be held on 4 and 5 February 2017. It aims to introduce introduce basic knot-tying and suturing skills to medical students. Each session will be led by a surgeon and students will be able to practise on bananas, diving suits and skin models. We hope that through this workshop, students may gain an early exposure to suturing techniques as well as develop an interest in surgery as a prospective career.</p>
