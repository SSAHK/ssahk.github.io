<p>The Students' Surgical Association of Hong Kong is proud to present its Annual Careers Evening! </p>

<p>SSAHK has invited a number of surgeons from different specialties to enlighten us with their knowledge and experience of being surgeons in their respected specialties. During the night, you will get to walk around and talk with our guests, not only about the academic aspects, but also about the lifestyle (e.g. hobbies, family and friends, work-life-balance) of a surgeon.</p>

<p>This will be a valuable opportunity for participants to learn more about a career in surgery, such as the different surgical specialties and what surgical training is like.</p>
