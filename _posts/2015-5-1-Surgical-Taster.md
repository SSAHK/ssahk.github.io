##Surgical Taster Day 2015

Surgical Taster Day is a one-day event which aims to provide local senior secondary school students (S4-S6 under the HKDSE curriculum or equivalent) with a taste in the field of Surgery. The event will be run twice during July and August, in order to best accommodate with participants’ schedules. An estimated number of 100 secondary school students would participate each day. Through interactive seminars on anatomy and surgical-related topics, practical skills sessions involving trying out suturing and knot-tying skills, as well as small group discussions with current medical students, we hope to foster interest in the surgical field in local prospective medical students.

##Objectives
- To provide secondary school students in Hong Kong early exposure to the field of Surgery
- To cultivate  secondary school students’ interest related to Surgery
- To facilitate interaction between prospective medical students and current members of the medical school
