<p>The Inauguration Ceremony 2016 of The Student Surgical Association of Hong Kong (SSAHK) was successfully held on 25th November 2016 at Hong Kong Academy of Medicine Jockey Club Building. The ceremony is a memorable occasion to celebrate the achievements and contribution of the outgoing executive committee and to introduce the 3rd executive committee to all our members.</p>
<p>It is our honour to have Prof Lam Tai Pong, Prof Yung Shu Hang, Dr Au Yiu Kai, Dr Lorraine Chow and Dr Cyrus Tse to witness our ceremony and to deliver inspiring speeches to all of us. We would also like to express our gratitude to the representatives from other student organizations for joining us on the day. Last but not least, we are grateful enough to have the 2nd executive committee building up an excellent foundation for us to embark on our new journey.</p>
<p>The 3rd executive committee is ready to continue the mission of SSAHK. We look forward to seeing you in our upcoming events!</p>
