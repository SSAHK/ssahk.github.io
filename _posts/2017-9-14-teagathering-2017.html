<p>To pre-clinical students, surgery may seem unfamiliar and far beyond reach. Understanding that, SSAHK has been active in providing numerous opportunities for medical students for the past three years. By organising a variety of surgically related events, SSAHK aims to encourage surgical exposure, interest and education at an undergraduate level. We need your support to continue to make this possible.</P>

<P>Applications for the <b>4th Executive Committee</b> will be open soon to medical students from both HKU and CUHK. Come to our <b>tea gathering</b> to learn more about the association and our mission! You will also have the exciting opportunity to experience a <b>suturing skills hands-on trial</b>!
