<p>On 25th and 26th June, 120 secondary school students participated in our Surgical Taster Days. The two-day programme was held at both CUHK and HKU medical faculties, each for a day. Actively engaged in our seminars, dissection sections, suturing workshops and the campus tracing games, the participants were bombarded with a blend of surgical knowledge and skills. Furthermore, they visited the Surgical Skills Center at HKU - even senior medical students may not have a chance to go there throughout their curriculum! And most importantly - they all survived!</P>
