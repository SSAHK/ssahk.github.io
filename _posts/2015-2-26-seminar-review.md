First Seminar, 14th November 2014

On 14th November 2014, we were delighted to have
Professor Enders Ng as the guest speaker for our first
seminar, titled ‘Inspiration to Become a Surgeon: From Very
Basic to Using the Robot’, held at the Prince of Wales
Hospital. With over 100 attending we are overjoyed with the
support shown by our fellow students.

### Interactive Seminar with Professor Enders Ng

Robotic surgery has been gaining prominence over the
past decade, thanks to rapid technological advancements.
With the aid of robotic arms, today’s surgeons are able to
operate with enhanced precision and dexterity, thereby
overcoming limitations of traditional surgeries and
improving patient care. As one of the leading figures in
this field, Professor Ng shared with us his personal
thoughts and memorable episodes encountered during his
career, as well as his visit to Southern Asia as a member
of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) following the tsunami in
2004.

Surgery is by all means a serious business, but amidst
the hustle and bustle in the hospital, a light dose of
humor is sometimes the best remedy to lift a little of the
burden from the surgeons’ shoulders. Apart from recalling
his myriad experiences, Professor Ng also recounted a
couple of personal entertaining anecdotes, revealing the
less sober side of the dynamics in the operating
theatre.

	
### Visit to the Minimal Invasive Surgical Centre, PWH

On top of the seminar, a concomitant trip to the MISC
was organized for pre-clinical students, which aimed at
offering them an opportunity to get a taste of operating
medical equipment. While students of the past were not able
to enjoy such privilege, today’s budding surgeons benefit
from a more resource-laden learning setting: Simulation
centres, in particular, serve as an excellent place for
them to gain hands on practice before actually putting on
their scrubs. The trip proved to be a unique and
stimulating experience for many.

Thank you for attending our first seminar. We hope you
found the experience rewarding, and we hope to see you at
our future events!
