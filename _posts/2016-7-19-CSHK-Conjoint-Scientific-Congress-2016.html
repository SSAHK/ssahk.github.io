“The RCSEd/CSHK Conjoint Scientific Congress 2016” is the annual event of the College of Surgeons of Hong Kong. This Congress will broaden our horizon on the latest surgical knowledge and technology and provide us with an excellent opportunity to meet with surgical leaders.

This year, the theme is “Making Wise Choices in Surgery”. Distinguished speakers from various specialties would be invited to share with us their expertise and hundreds of delegates from local, mainland and overseas would be attracted to the Congress. Various surgical colleges and disciplines as well as prominent international figures will also gather to provide a multi-disciplinary Congress.
