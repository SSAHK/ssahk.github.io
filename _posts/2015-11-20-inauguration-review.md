We are delighted to present the 2nd executive committee of Student Surgical Association of Hong Kong!
Last Friday was the Inauguration Ceremony of the executive committee 2015-16. We are honored to have with us our honorary guests Prof. Lau J.Y.W. and Dr. Gordan Wong, representatives from both CUHK and HKU faculty of medicine, as well as our past executive committee members, in this notable occasion.

We would like to once again thank our founding committee for their foresight in establishing SSAHK and steering it in the direction it has taken. We are ready to embark on our new journey and embrace the challenges ahead. Please stay tuned for our upcoming events!
