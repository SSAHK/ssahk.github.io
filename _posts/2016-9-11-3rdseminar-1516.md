excerpt: Paediatric surgery? How is it different?
---

## Background
Developed as a distinct specialty locally since the 60s, Paediatric surgery is currently one of the most vigorously growing fields in surgery. Since its establishment, there was remarkable improvement in the survival rate of newborns with congenital surgical anomalies.

Paediatric surgeons operate on children of different age, ranging from newborn to the adolescents. Children are not simply small adults and the surgical problems are often quite different from those commonly encountered by adult general surgeons.
