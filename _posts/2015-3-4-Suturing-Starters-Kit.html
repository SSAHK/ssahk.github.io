<p>Welcome to the Suturing Workshops! You must be more than eager to start trying, but here are some information to get started in case you are puzzling about each and every details of the skills.</p>

<p>We would encourage you to go through these materials before participating in the suturing workshops. For non-participants, feel free to use these as learning materials to get a gist of the basic suturing skills!</p>
<p>(For simpler skills like knot tying you can always practice with a piece of thread at home.)</p>

<p><i>NOTE: There are multiple ways to do a knot. The detailed steps illustrated here may differ from what is taught by your tutor.</i></p>

		<h3>General Description</h3>
		<p>This maneuver is accomplished by first grasping the fixed suture end with the
		small and ring fingers, while it is being pinched between the tips of the index
		finger and thumb. By pronating the wrist, a loop forms around the grasped
		fingers, and the top of the loop must again be grasped between the tips of the
		thumb and index fingers. The small and ring fingers are then withdrawn from
		the loop before coiling more suture. The rasped suture can be easily lengthened
		by releasing the coils held between the tips of the thumb and index finger.</p>
		
		<h3>Clinical Significance</h3>
		<p>The value of instrument ties has become readily apparent in special situations
		in which hand ties are impractical or impossible. In microsurgical procedures,
		an instrument tie provides the most reliable and easiest method of knot
		construction. When employing suture in the recesses of the body (e.g. mouth,
		vagina, etc.) or during endoscopic surgery, instruments can also form knots in
		sites to which the hand could never gain access</p>
		
		<h3>Gives and Takes</h3>
		<p>When tying knots with an instrument, it is difficult to apply continuous
		tension to the suture ends. Consequently, widening of the suture loop due to
		slippage is frequently encountered in wounds subjected to strong tension. This
		technique, however, is ideally suited for closing a wound which is subjected to
		weak tensions. In this circumstance, instrument ties can be accomplished more
		rapidly and accurately than hand ties, while conserving considerably more
		suture. By using this technique, the parsimonious surgeon can complete 10
		interrupted suture loops from one suture measuring 18 inches in length. This
		feat would be impossible if the knots had been tied by hand.</p>

	<blockquote>A simple interrupted suture technique is useful for easy closure of traumatic and surgical wounds. Begin by entering the skin with the needle at a 90° angle to the skin. Full-thickness tissue bites encompass the epidermis and dermis. The first throw of the knot is a surgeon’s knot, and all subsequent knots should lie squarely on the previous knot. The sutures should be spaced close enough to coapt the tissues but not cause ischemia.

		Hand Tie is somewhat the most difficult part of the course, but it is a must-learn skill for surgeons regardless of the sub-speciality you choose. Most surgeons prefer hand tie over instrument tie, if that matters.</p>

		<p>Some tips:

		- Remember one side of the string is passive and the other side is active
		
		- The outcome should be a square knot, and if you try to push the knot sideways it would not be adjustable
