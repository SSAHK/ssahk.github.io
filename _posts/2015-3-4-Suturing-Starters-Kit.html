<p>Welcome to the Suturing Workshops! You must be more than eager to start trying, but here are some information to get started in case you are puzzling about each and every details of the skills.</p>

<p>We would encourage you to go through these materials before participating in the suturing workshops. For non-participants, feel free to use these as learning materials to get a gist of the basic suturing skills!</p>
<p>(For simpler skills like knot tying you can always practice with a piece of thread at home.)</p>

		Hand Tie is somewhat the most difficult part of the course, but it is a must-learn skill for surgeons regardless of the sub-speciality you choose. Most surgeons prefer hand tie over instrument tie, if that matters.</p>

		<p>Some tips:

		- Remember one side of the string is passive and the other side is active
		
		- The outcome should be a square knot, and if you try to push the knot sideways it would not be adjustable
