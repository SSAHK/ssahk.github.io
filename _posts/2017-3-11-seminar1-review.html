<p>On the 3rd of March, we hosted our first seminar of the academic year on the topic of Women in Surgery. Presenting to a group of enthusiastic medical students were Dr Lorraine Chow and Dr Violet Tsoi, the chairlady and the vice-chairlady of the Women's Chapter of the College of Surgeons of Hong Kong.</P>
<p>During the seminar, both doctors openly shared their experiences of being a surgeon from a women's perspective, speaking about complex lifestyle dilemmas including being pregnant during surgical training, raising a family despite having a busy schedule and the need to maintain hobbies to relieve stress throughout one's career. They also discussed about the nature of their careers as general surgeons specialising in breast surgery.</P>
<P>It was an insightful talk as everyone learned more about things commonly thought about but rarely discussed in medical school. Once again SSAHK would like to thank both doctors for an eventful night.</P>
