<p>The 2017 Advanced Surgical Workshop was successfully held on 11th February (Sat) in the CUHK Jockey Club Minimally Invasive Surgical Skills Centre (MISSC) at the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH). We wish that all participants would have enjoyed the experience of suturing on pig skins and gained insights into diversified suturing techniques. Thank you all for coming!</P>
<p>Meanwhile, we would also like to express our deepest gratitude to Prof. Kaori Futaba and Dr. Jason Chan for being our respected tutors of the workshop. Thank you very much!</p>
