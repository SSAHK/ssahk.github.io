SSAHK annual Careers Night was successfully held on 4th March, 2016. This year we invited surgeons and professors from different specialties, including pediatric surgery, colorectal surgery, gastrointestinal surgery and cardiology. We are very honored to have Prof. CS Lau, Prof. Bernard Cheung, Dr. Jennifer Mou, Dr. Shirley Liu, Dr. Cyrus Tse and Dr. Kendrick Shih in our careers evening - to share with us their insights and experience of working in surgery. Our participants and the surgeons also had a lovely dinner together and discussed in small groups about career choices and personal stories.

May we once again take this opportunity to thank the surgeons and professors, for spending their time with us and for giving us valuable advice. We would also like to thank our members for your active participation - we hope you had a great time bonding with surgeons, and a better understanding of careers in medicine and surgery. SSAHK wish you all the best in your future endeavors!
