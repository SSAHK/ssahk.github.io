## Day 1 at the University of Hong Kong

With over 120 secondary school students taking part, the Surgical Taster Day 2016 was held on 26/06 and 02/07 with flying colours.

At the medical campus of The University of Hong Kong, the first day of the event commenced with sharing sessions by Dr. CHAN Lap Ki, Associate Professor in the School of Biomedical Science (former Department of Anatomy) of Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, and Professor LAW Wai Lun, Associate Dean of Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine. Dr. Chan shared on the topic “Anatomy”, the very cornerstone , from various perspective such as the nature, the development and some recent research. Professor Law demonstrated the application of robots in minimally invasive surgeries and its pros and cons illustrated with the latest robotic surgery model - da Vinci Surgical System.

In the afternoon, participants had the chance to learn some basic surgical skills. Divided in groups each with a surgeon, participant had a crash course focusing on skills to tie surgical knots and suture wounds. Our knot-tying and suturing workshops aim to provide participants with some hands-on experience into surgery which may test them upon patience, stable hands and level of focus. Participants found it interesting and challenging to suture together a open wound on a fake skin imitated by a diving suit.

Problem-based learning(PBL) is a student-centred mode of learning adopted by the medical school of HKU. With the aim of “Learning how to learn”, PBL places students in the active roles of problem-solvers which can simultaneously develops both problem solving strategies and disciplinary knowledge bases. The case this year is a patient suffering from recurrent peptic ulcer which requires surgical intervention. During the PBL session, participants were given short abstracts of different patient information where they are guided by tutors to brainstorm and discuss possible causes, diagnosis, and other related issues. PBL may be difficult to be adopted to in the beginning, yet, despite their limited knowledge in medicine, they can still get a grasp of this innovative mode of learning. In addition to PBL, participants also have a chance to talk to their tutors who were mostly preclinical medical students who shared their joys and hardships in medical schools.

## Day 2 at the Chinese University of Hong Kong

The second day of Surgical Taster Day 2016 was held at the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The morning started with our “Quizbowl” - a quiz game related to interesting medical and surgical knowledge. Participants in groups are required to answer the question shown on screen within a short duration, only with the help from their group leaders who are pre-clinical students. Questions range from about basic anatomy to case diagnosis, in different forms from MCQ to True or False. Once their answers are submitted, the correct options are shown on screen with brief explanation by the MC. The lecture theatre was filled with whispering during discussion and laughter when correct answers are shown.

Following the Quizbowl is our Campus Tracing Games which require participants to explore different little corners in the campus of CUHK and complete tasks at checkpoints to get score. In contrast to ordinary campus tracing, our checkpoint tasks are much more medically related. One task requires participants to generate the full term of some acronym such as MRI, HIV and ICU. Another task requires participants to match some descriptions or laymen terms with another description such as “The largest organ in body” and “Skin”.

After a relaxing morning, we continued with a more intensive and educational session of “Introduction to Common Surgeries”. Participants spent two and a half hour at the Dissection Laboratory getting more exposure to different specialties of Surgery. With the aid of some specimen and models, participants were taught the basic anatomy, pathology involved, indication and procedure of 12 different types of surgeries in 12 stations respectively by clinical year medical students. Though each station was given 12 minutes only owing to time limit, this would be a valuable experience for participants to understand the learning environment of medical students and to have a glimpse of different Surgical specialties.

The event ended with the Closing Ceremony and Prize Presentation session. Our President Mr. Manton Woo, on behalf of the Committee members,  hoped that every participant could figure out their own path of life and wished them every success in their future.
