						<h4 id="sharing-sessions-by-medical-professionals">Sharing Sessions by Medical Professionals</h4>
						<p>To give local secondary school students a glimpse into the surgical area as well as ethical issues encountered by professionals, surgeons and staff share their personal experience with our participants in a semi­formal manner.</p>
						<h4 id="knottying-and-suturing-session-day-1">Knot­tying and Suturing Session (Day 1)</h4>
						<p>Participants are provided with the opportunity to try knot­tying as well as some fundamental suturing skills. This session will be led by surgeons and/or student helpers. We hope the hands­-on practice will prove to be an invaluable experience for the participants.</p>
						<p>Proposed Skills: </p>
						<ul>
						<li>Handling of instruments including scalpels, scissors, artery forceps and needle holders </li>
						<li>Instrument tie (square knot) </li>
						<li>Hand tie (square knot) </li>
						<li>Interrupted sutures </li>
						</ul>
						<h4 id="simulated-tutorials-and-sharing-session-by-students-day-1">Simulated Tutorials and Sharing Session by Students (Day 1)</h4>
						<p>Participants will experience simulated tutorials in a Problem-­Based Learning style, during which surgical related topics will be discussed using layman terms. This session aims to to provide participants with rudimentary knowledge of common surgeries as well as a taste of a typical tutorial.</p>
						<p>Additionally, current medical students (clinical and/or pre­-clinical) will share their medical school life, in particular, challenges they have encountered and ways to overcome them. Through interaction, we aim to deepen participants’ understanding of medical school life and answer some of the questions they may have in mind, which will hopefully aid them in making informed decisions when choosing university majors.</p>
						<h4 id="introduction-to-common-surgeries-day-2">Introduction to Common Surgeries (Day 2)</h4>
						<p>Participants would gain deeper insight into some common diseases and their surgical principles under the guidance of surgeons. Specimens would be displayed with explanations from helpers to help illustrate the relevant anatomy. </p>
						<p>These surgeries are proposed due to their high frequency and great relevance to the general public. We hope this would prove to be a unique experience for the participants. </p>
