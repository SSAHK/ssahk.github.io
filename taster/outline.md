Surgical Taster Day is a two-day event which aims to provide local senior secondary school students (S4-S6 under the HKDSE curriculum or equivalent) with a taste in the field of Surgery. The event will be run in early July in order to best accommodate with participants’ schedules. An estimated number of 100 secondary school students would participate each day and they are welcome to join either day only as well. Through interactive seminars on anatomy and surgical-related topics, practical skills sessions involving trying out suturing and
knot-tying skills, small group discussions with current medical students, and simulation of learning settings, we hope to foster interest in the surgical field in local prospective medical students.

##Objectives
- To provide secondary school students in Hong Kong early exposure to the field of Surgery
- To cultivate  secondary school students’ interest related to Surgery
- To facilitate interaction between prospective medical students and current members of the medical school

##Date and Venue

Day 1: 11th July 2015 (Sat) in The University of Hong Kong

Day 2: 12th July 2015 (Sun) in The Chinese University of Hong Kong
