          <p>Surgical Taster Day is a two-day event which aims to provide local senior secondary school students (S4-S6 under the HKDSE curriculum or equivalent) with a taste in the field of Surgery. The event will be run in early July in order to best accommodate with participants’ schedules. An estimated number of 100 secondary school students would participate each day and they are welcome to join either day only as well. Through interactive seminars on anatomy and surgical-related topics, practical skills sessions involving trying out suturing and
          knot-tying skills, small group discussions with current medical students, and simulation of learning settings, we hope to foster interest in the surgical field in local prospective medical students.</p>
