					<p>After completing his medical education at CUHK, Professor Ng Chi Fai Anthony joined the Department of Surgery at Prince of Wales Hospital as a surgical trainee. He completed his training in Urology in 2001. With a keen interest in the endourology, he went to Scotland for a year to gain extensive experience in endo-laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery, uro-oncology and stone management.</p>

					<p>Currently, Professor Ng is a professor of Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, CUHK and the Co-director of Youth Urological Treatment Centre. His main interests include urolithiasis, prostate diseases and Men's Health. He also received the Outstanding Young Urologist Award in 2010 by the Asian Congress of Urology as recognition to his work in the field.</p>

					<p>Previously worked as a designer, Mr. Pasu Ng was determined to pursue a different career path. He is now an embalmer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. His duties include body embalming, specimen production and the operation of teaching at the dissection laboratory.</p>

					<p>Despite his busy schedule, Mr. Ng is actively involved in the promotion and operation of the Body Donation Programme “Silent Teachers”. In addition to his contribution in medical school, he values every opportunity to spread positive messages about life and death, in which he created a Life and Death Education group on Facebook with Rev. Chris Wong. The group has attracted over 3,000 members.</p>
