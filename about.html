				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>The Student Surgical Association of Hong Kong (SSAHK) is a student organization jointly run by medical students from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It aims to broaden students’ horizons in different surgical specialties by connecting medical students from both medical schools with the surgeons.</p>
				<p>We hope the establishment of the Association can provide medical students with opportunities from extra skills teaching to networking and socializing. Ultimately, we aim at encouraging surgical exposure, interest and education at an undergraduate level. And through organising events like career nights, we strive to provide a better communication platform between practising surgeons and medical students.</p>
