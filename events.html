<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Times"><b><i>The Year Ahead</i></b></h2>
<p class="p3">In the academic year 2016/2017, we will organize suturing workshops, career nights and regular seminars for all Hong Kong medical students. We may also send a team of representatives for International Symposium in 2016.</p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times"><b>Regular Seminars</b></h3>
<p class="p3">Surgical pioneers will share with us their personal experiences, and the reasons why they chose to become a surgeon. Furthermore, there will be talks on technological breakthroughs in surgery, such as robotic surgery, and other advancing techniques that are put into practice recently. Finally, they will talk about medical studentsâ€™ future career paths, and the preparation needed to pursue a surgical career.</p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times"><b>Careers Night</b></h3>
<p class="p3">It is a semi-formal event. Students will have the chance to meet and talk with surgical experts from different specialties in a relaxing environment. We expect it to help in building lasting relationships between the students and the surgeons.</p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times"><b>Suturing Workshop</b></h3>
<p class="p3">It is an introductory session on suturing and knot tying, in which a mentor will teach students in a small-group setting (Around 20 pre-clinical students). Each participant will receive their own set of materials. We may offer advanced courses in the future.</p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times"><b>International Symposium</b></h3>
<p class="p3">In order to build connections with surgical societies around the world, we will register with the <a href="http://www.iasss.org/"><span class="s2">International Association of Student Surgical Societies</span></a> (IASSS) this year. There will be exchange opportunities with other universities and we may send representatives to the International Symposium of IASSS in the summer of 2016.</p>
