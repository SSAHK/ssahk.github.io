		<h2>The Year Ahead</h2>

		<p>In the academic year 2014/2015, we will organize
		suturing workshops, career nights and regular seminars for
		all Hong Kong medical students. We may also send a team of
		representatives for International Symposium in 2015.</p>

						<h3>Regular Seminars</h3>
						<p>Surgical pioneers will share with us their
						personal experiences, and the reasons why they
						chose to become a surgeon. Furthermore, there will
						be talks on technological breakthroughs in surgery,
						such as robotic surgery, and other advancing
						techniques that are put into practice recently.
						Finally, they will talk about medical studentsâ€™
						future career paths, and the preparation needed to
						pursue a surgical career.</p>

						<h3>Careers Night</h3>
						<p>It is a semi-formal event. Students will have
						the chance to meet and talk with surgical experts
						from different specialties in a relaxing
						environment. We expect it to help in building
						lasting relationships between the students and the
						surgeons.</p>

						<h3>Suturing Workshop</h3>
						<p>It is an introductory session on suturing and
						knot tying, in which a mentor will teach students
						in a small-group setting (Around 8-10 pre-clinical
						students). Each participant will receive their own
						set of materials. We may offer advanced courses in
						the future.</p>

						societies around the world, we will register with
						the <a href="http://www.iasss.org/">International Association of Student Surgical
						Societies</a> (IASSS) this year. There will be exchange
						opportunities with other universities and we may
