			<h2>The Year Ahead</h2>

			<p>In the academic year 2014/2015, we will organize
			suturing workshops, career nights and regular seminars for
			all Hong Kong medical students. We may also send a team of
			representatives for International Symposium in 2015.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="medium-6 small-12 columns">
		
					<h3>Regular Seminars</h3>

					<p>Surgical pioneers will share with us their
					personal experiences, and the reasons why they
					chose to become a surgeon. Furthermore, there will
					be talks on technological breakthroughs in surgery,
					such as robotic surgery, and other advancing
					techniques that are put into practice recently.
					Finally, they will talk about medical students’
					future career paths, and the preparation needed to
					pursue a surgical career.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="medium-6 small-12 columns">
					<h3>Careers Night</h3>

					<p>It is a semi-formal event. Students will have
					the chance to meet and talk with surgical experts
					from different specialties in a relaxing
					environment. We expect it to help in building
					lasting relationships between the students and the
					surgeons.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="medium-6 small-12 columns">
					<h3>Suturing Workshop</h3>

					<p>It is an introductory session on suturing and
					knot tying, in which a mentor will teach students
					in a small-group setting (Around 8-10 pre-clinical
					students). Each participant will receive their own
					set of materials. We may offer advanced courses in
					the future.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="medium-6 small-12 columns">
					<h3>International Symposium</h3>

					<p>In order to build connections with surgical
					societies around the world, we will register with
					the International Association of Student Surgical
					Societies (IASSS) this year. There will be exchange
					opportunities with other universities and we may
					send representatives to the International Symposium
					of IASSS in the summer of 2015.</p>

			<h2>Surgical Challenges in the Tropics</h2>

			<p>Third Seminar, 6th February 2015</p>

			<p>On the evening of 6th February 2015, we were delighted to have Professor Sydney Chung as our guest speaker for our third seminar titled "Surgical Challenges in the Tropics". Professor Chung is one of the most locally renowned surgical pioneers as well as the former Dean of the Medical Faculty of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
</p>
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 columns">
			<p>During the seminar, Professor Chung shared his experiences of treating impoverished patients in Papua New Guinea from 2004 to 2007. The country was amidst hostile circumstances at the time; Its medical resources were thus inadequate to provide proper treatment to its people. Despite having limited equipment, Professor Chung seeked to overcome challenges by maximizing resources available and drawing upon his innovation. In a particularly memorable operation, he utilized fishing lines in place of suturing threads. His patients were commonly victims of domestic violence and intertribal conflicts, whose suffering extended beyond the physiological level. While technology unquestionably facilitates diagnosis and treatment, Professor Chung believed that physicians shall be wary of its overreliance; Hands-on clinical skills and a quick mind will always remain fundamental to successful surgical operations.
</p>

			<p>On a lighter note, Professor Chung shared with us his favourite pastimes - skydiving and training with his saxophone. A fervent musical fan, he also hopes to become a member of a jazz band to give public performances.
</p>

			<p>Three years of serving in the Oceanian country proves to be a life-transforming experience for Professor Chung, not only offering him deeper insights into local struggles but a new perspective on humanity. We hope you found the seminar inspiring and stimulating, and we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming activities!

			<h2>Inspiration to become a surgeon: from very basic to
			using the robot</h2>

			<p>First Seminar, 14th November 2014</p>

			<p>On 14th November 2014, we were delighted to have
			Professor Enders Ng as the guest speaker for our first
			seminar, titled ‘Inspiration to Become a Surgeon: From Very
			Basic to Using the Robot’, held at the Prince of Wales
			Hospital. With over 100 attending we are overjoyed with the
			support shown by our fellow students.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 columns">
			<h3>Interactive Seminar with Professor Enders Ng</h3>

			<p>Robotic surgery has been gaining prominence over the
			past decade, thanks to rapid technological advancements.
			With the aid of robotic arms, today’s surgeons are able to
			operate with enhanced precision and dexterity, thereby
			overcoming limitations of traditional surgeries and
			improving patient care. As one of the leading figures in
			this field, Professor Ng shared with us his personal
			thoughts and memorable episodes encountered during his
			career, as well as his visit to Southern Asia as a member
			of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) following the tsunami in
			2004.</p>

			<p>Surgery is by all means a serious business, but amidst
			the hustle and bustle in the hospital, a light dose of
			humor is sometimes the best remedy to lift a little of the
			burden from the surgeons’ shoulders. Apart from recalling
			his myriad experiences, Professor Ng also recounted a
			couple of personal entertaining anecdotes, revealing the
			less sober side of the dynamics in the operating
			theatre.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 columns">
			<h3>Visit to the Minimal Invasive Surgical Centre, PWH</h3>

			<p>On top of the seminar, a concomitant trip to the MISC
			was organized for pre-clinical students, which aimed at
			offering them an opportunity to get a taste of operating
			medical equipment. While students of the past were not able
			to enjoy such privilege, today’s budding surgeons benefit
			from a more resource-laden learning setting: Simulation
			centres, in particular, serve as an excellent place for
			them to gain hands on practice before actually putting on
			their scrubs. The trip proved to be a unique and
			stimulating experience for many.</p>

			<p>Thank you for attending our first seminar. We hope you
			found the experience rewarding, and we hope to see you at
			our future events!</p>
